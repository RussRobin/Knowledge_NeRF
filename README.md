# Knowledge_NeRF
This is the official implementation for Knowledge NeRF: Few-shot Novel View Synthesis for Dynamic Articulated Objects.
[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00674)]

## Install

Please refer to [NeRF-pytorch](https://github.com/yenchenlin/nerf-pytorch).

## Datasets

We propose a new dynamic dataset consisting of synthetic and real-world articulated objects, consisting of 2 spaces: original space and deformed space. If you are interested in our dataset, please reach out to `russ000robin@gmail.com`.

[NeRF Synthetic Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934) and
[Shiny Blender Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03907) 
are also adopted in our paper.

## Run

Our method includes 3 steps:
1. Initialize projection module
2. Train projection module
3. Finetune projection module and original NeRF

Please `bash pipeline.sh` to run Knowledge NeRF.
