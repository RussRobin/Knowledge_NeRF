# Knowledge_NeRF
This is the official implementation for Knowledge NeRF: Few-shot Novel View Synthesis for Dynamic Articulated Objects.

(Paper under review, arXiv version available soon).

## Install

Please refer to [NeRF-pytorch](https://github.com/yenchenlin/nerf-pytorch). Great thanks to NeRF-pytorch!

## Datasets

We propose a new dynamic dataset consisting of synthetic and real-world articulated objects, consisting of 2 spaces (original space and deformed space).

(Available soon)

## Run

Our method includes 3 steps:
1. Initialize projection module
2. Train projection module
3. Finetune projection module and original NeRF

Please `bash pipeline.sh` to run Knowledge NeRF.
